# Φ@I Radiation

Φ@I Radiation series has been started to facilitate productive discussions among physics graduates of IISER Mohali. At present, it has the following three sections.
* Revision Section: Here we will revise topics the audience is already expected to know
* Technology Section: This is for discussion of relavent tools for enhancing efficiency
* Research Section: The speaker will either discuss recent progress or their own research at a broad enough level


## Upcoming

The latest session is scheduled to be held on **Sunday Oct 16, 2016** at **10 00 (GMT)**.

Hi

Tomorrow we'll have the fourth session of **Φ@I Radiation** at 10 00 (GMT). Please visit [the website](http://github.com/toAtulArora/radiation) for a link to join. It will be posted an hour in advance (roughly). This weekend we intend to start revision of Mechancis, by Landau, with the ambitious goal of completing the entire series. Bhati has agreed to do the first session. Kishor will present his research, "Quantum Simulation using Photon and Polaritons", in the research section. Looking forward to seeing everyone.

Sincerely

Atul

Hi there,

This is an invitation to the first session of **Φ@I Radiation**. I know each of you will continue to become better at your fields. To keep in touch with the future hot-shot scientists, we (me and Kishor) decided that perhaps having a regular "google hangouts" will be a good idea.

In the very first run, we intend to have one section (15-20 minutes) on revision, followed by one (15-20 minutes again) that discusses tools relevant to academia. The idea is that each week we should recall what we already know, invest a little in becoming more efficient, and (in the future sessions) learn about the research backgrounds of our fellow speakers.

Since at the moment we have only started, we will use the third (15-20 minute) slot for getting feedback on the said idea.

Kishor will do the "revision section", I will do the "tech session" and the last "discussion section" will be open. We start at 10:00 PM tonight. We will send you the links appropriately.

Sincerely

Atul
