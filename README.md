# Φ@I Radiation

### Babble version
Hi there,

This is an invitation to the first session of **Φ@I Radiation**. I know each of you will continue to become better at your fields. To keep in touch with the future hot-shot scientists, we (me and Kishor) decided that perhaps having a regular "google hangouts" will be a good idea.

In the very first run, we intend to have one section (15-20 minutes) on revision, followed by one (15-20 minutes again) that discusses tools relevant to academia. The idea is that each week we should recall what we already know, invest a little in becoming more efficient, and (in the future sessions) learn about the research backgrounds of our fellow speakers.

Since at the moment we have only started, we will use the third (15-20 minute) slot for getting feedback on the said idea.

Kishor will do the "revision section", I will do the "tech session" and the last "discussion section" will be open. We start at 10:00 PM tonight. We will send you the links appropriately.

Sincerely

Atul
